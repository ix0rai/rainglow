## overview
Rainglow changes the colours of your glow squids, letting them be all the colours of the rainbow!
It also includes configurability through different modes, including pride modes! Make your glow squids gorgeous.

## features
- 10+ different glow squid colours!
- a configuration file with many modes, including pride modes, rainbow, monochrome, and more! documentation on this can be found [here](https://github.com/ix0rai/rainglow/wiki/config)
- no dependencies - works as soon as you put it in your mods folder
- lightweight and removable - after removing the mod, your glow squids will simply revert to blue with no damage to your save file
- server sync - the configuration file can be synced from the server to the client, meaning that all players on your server will use the same options. documentation on this can be found [here](https://github.com/ix0rai/rainglow/wiki/server-sync)
- custom modes - modes are data-driven, meaning that you can create your own modes and add them to the game! documentation on this can be found [here](https://github.com/ix0rai/rainglow/wiki/creating-custom-modes)

#### server-side optional!
This mod does not need to be installed on the server to function!
It works from the client side, so you can install it on your client and play on any server without needing to ask the server owner to install it.
However, without a server installation glow squids will forget their colours when you leave the world and get new random ones when you rejoin.
Colours cannot be synced between players without installing rainglow on the server.
